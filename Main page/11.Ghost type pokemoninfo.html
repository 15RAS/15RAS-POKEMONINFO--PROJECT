        <h3><i> Ghost-Type Pokémon</i></h3>

        <p>Ghost-type Pokémon occupy a uniquely intriguing niche within the Pokémon universe, embodying the ethereal and mysterious aspects of the supernatural. From the hauntingly elegant Gengar to the enigmatic Chandelure, these spectral creatures captivate trainers with their eerie designs, otherworldly abilities, and strategic versatility.

            At the forefront of their allure is their ghostly nature, which grants them immunity to Normal and Fighting-type moves while also making them resistant to Poison-type attacks. This inherent advantage in battle, coupled with their often high Special Attack stats, positions Ghost-types as formidable adversaries capable of dealing out significant damage while shrugging off many common offensive strategies.
            
            Moreover, Ghost-type Pokémon possess a wide array of unique moves and abilities that further enhance their strategic viability. Moves like Shadow Ball, Shadow Claw, and Hex are staples of Ghost-type strategies, allowing these Pokémon to strike fear into the hearts of opponents while bypassing defenses and exploiting weaknesses. Meanwhile, abilities like Cursed Body and Pressure exert additional pressure on opponents, forcing them to think carefully about their actions in battle.
            
            Beyond their combat prowess, Ghost-type Pokémon are steeped in lore and mystique, often associated with haunted locations, ancient curses, and tales of the afterlife. Many Ghost-type Pokémon are inspired by folklore and mythology from various cultures around the world, adding depth and richness to their designs and narratives. This infusion of cultural significance not only enhances the immersion of the Pokémon world but also fosters a sense of wonder and curiosity among players.
            
            In terms of design, Ghost-type Pokémon encompass a wide range of forms and inspirations, from traditional specters and phantoms to more abstract manifestations of the supernatural.
